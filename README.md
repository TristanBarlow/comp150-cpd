# comp150-cpd

## Week 1

Our week started with a comp 110 lecture on computing principles, in this we learnt certain rules surrounding variables and how to assign them. During this lecture I made mistakes answering the questions we were given. I found myself rushing to answer the questions and as a result making errors such as; not reading the questions properly. I believe by taking a bit time and executing every line of code as the computer would this will not happen again. In the comp 150 lecture on Wednesday we were assigned the task of designing a board game at first there was no time limit but one was later added and as a team we found ourselves with very little time. This resulted in us not being able to produce a working prototype. During a reflection period we identified that this could’ve been avoided by working in parallel. Rather than all work on the same task we should’ve split tasks to achieve a higher productivity overall.  I am going to keep this in mind when we next do a group project.
