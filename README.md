## Week 1 ##

Our week started with a comp 110 lecture on computing principles, in this we learnt certain rules surrounding variables and how to assign them. During this lecture I made mistakes answering the questions we were given. I found myself rushing to answer the questions and as a result making errors such as; not reading the questions properly. I believe by taking a bit time and executing every line of code as the computer would this will not happen again. In the comp 150 lecture on Wednesday we were assigned the task of designing a board game at first there was no time limit but one was later added and as a team we found ourselves with very little time. This resulted in us not being able to produce a working prototype. During a reflection period we identified that this could’ve been avoided by working in parallel. Rather than all work on the same task we should’ve split tasks to achieve a higher productivity overall.  I am going to keep this in mind when we next do a group project.

## Week 2 ##
This week started with a comp 110 lecture, we learnt mainly about pseudocode and flowcharts how and when to use them. We were split in to small groups (2-3) and asked to write a flowchart on how we would log in to facebook. Unfortunately due to my inability to understand my partners ideas i found myself being more inclined to my own ideas of what a flowchart 'should' look like. As a result there were no arrows on our first flowchart making it difficult to understand. In future I will always make an effort to understand others ideas and hear the opinions/ideas of everyone involved before any action is taken. We were set another task during Wednesdays comp 150 lecture. The aim was to produce a prototype of a text game based on random 'idea' cards provided by the lecturer. Keeping in mind the target I set for myself last week, I quickly suggested to split into groups so as to maximise efficiency. The prototype thanks to the groups effort was a very good representation of what the game could've been. Next week my goal is to study at least 2 extra research papers going into more depth about
